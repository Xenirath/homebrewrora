      <p><i>Prerequisites: Ability to cast at least 1 spell and play at least 1 instrument</i></p>
      <p>As a magical caster and performer you've spent several hours practicing your craft to be as unique and useful as possible. This allows you to gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-Increase your Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
        <li>-You gain proficiency in Performance. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.</li>
        <li>-When casting a spell with a verbal component you may make a Performance check against viewers' passive (Perception). If you are successful they are unaware of a spell being cast and believe it is just a performance. If you succeed by 5 or more you can choose to have the performance be silent.</li>
      </ul>
