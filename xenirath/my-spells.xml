			<p class="flavor">You conjure an orb that pulls foes towards it.</p>
			<p>You create a magical orb of iron at a point of your choice within range. The orb is 3 feet in diameter, and floats 2 feet above the ground. Each creature that starts it's turn within 20 feet of the orb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards the orb. Any creature within 20 feet of the orb must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving away from the orb. Any creature that touches the orb must make a Strenght saving throw or take 1d10 lightning damage. Unattended inanimate objects that weigh 5 pounds or less within 20 feet of the orb are also pulled towards it at a rate of 10 feet per round. The caster cannot be affected by the orb's effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum range that the orb's pulling can reach increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>
